# Flexible Calculator

This project implements a simple, extensible calculator that supports multiple operations. The calculator is designed with the Open-Closed Principle in mind, allowing new operations to be added without modifying the existing code.

## Features

- Basic operations: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE
- Support for chaining multiple operations
- Extensible with new operations
- Handles invalid operations gracefully
- IoC compatible for dependency injection

## Usage

1. Use the `calculate` method for basic operations:
   ```java
   Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
   double result = calculator.calculate(Operation.ADD, 5.0, 3.0);
